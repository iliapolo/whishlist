Wish List
=========

This repository contains a curated list of ideas.

Ideas? let me explain.

Each directory is this repo contains a description of an open source, apache licensed tool that has been suggested
and approved by the community. The "community" is essentialy every one that wants to be a part of it.
A tool can have 3 possible states:

- I wish

This means that the idea was proposed, discussed, and approved as a tool that is actually neeeded and people
want to see implemented. If a project is in this state, it is up for grabs by anyone who wants to start working
on it. Hopefully, if multiple people wish to work on the same idea, they can do it together and collabarate.

- Im on it

This means that someone was awsome enough to take on the challange and start working on it.
If the project is in this state, its description should contain a link to the appropriate GitHub repo
so that people could keep track of it and participate in its development.

- Reality

This means the idea has become a reality and is ready to be consumed by the community.

**This is the whole point of this repo, for ideas to become reality.**

Think of it as a proucer-consumer queue of ideas :)

(God that sounds a bit dushy, sorry about that)


## Motivation

How this whole thing came about?

Warning, personal story ahead, you can skip it if you dont feel like reading it.

Well, about two years ago, after working for 5 years in one place, i switched jobs.
Like most people, when they experience a big change in a certain aspect of their life, i kind of start reflecting
on what i have **been** doing, and what i want to **be** doing. I was always really impressed by the open source
community and have benfited from its fruits greatly. I really wanted to be an active part of it, which meant, for me,
producing, not just consuming. So i decided that i was gonna create at least one project that im passionate about and i
think can help the community.

Unfourtuntely, i couldn't come up with a good enough idea and was hit with a creative block. In addition, this new job
was in a startup that kept me busy pretty much 24/7. The idea died down and i sunk into my day job full power.
It had always bothered me, especially as i started seeing more and more cool open source projects sprouting like
mushrooms.

Fast forward a few months, i was given an assignment at work that made me think of a cool tool that i thought might
be useful. Finally! i was excited about it, and couldn't wait to start working on it.

Here is a tip for you: Before you start writing code, you should create a proper README for your repo.
Because if you cant formulate a coherent description of what you want to do, and what is it good for, you probably
shouldn't be writing the code for it.

And so i did.

Here is another tip: Once you do finish the README, start working on the code immediately and dont let it sit, even a
single function a day keeps your project alive, under resuscitation, but alive.

Aaaaaaaaaaaand so I didn't...

Again, some doubts started creeping in, time was a scarse resource and the project died once more.

Fast forward 12 months, the idea trickled down my brain again and i wanted to revisit it. However, my own need
for the tool was no longer there, and the passion for it has disipated a bit. It got me thinking
about the process i went through with this project, that essentially started with the idea of participating in
the open source community, and i wondered: "Hmm, perhaps there is a different tool that people want, something more
useful? I wish i had a list of projects to choose from.".

This is why this endevour was born.

Another reason i think this list is necessary is because i think this method of collabaration is missing from the
current state of affairs. Seems to me that open source projects are usually created under the following circumstances:

- You are handed an assignment at work, that either tranformes into or inspires an open source project.
- You come up with some idea on your own, starting writing the code, release an alpha version and start discussing and
  collabarating with people.

Projects are not created from a discussion of the entire community. Also, i feel like even many individually started
projects might benefit from this.

## Statement of Intent

I'd like this repo to become a collabaration focal point for the birth and development of many useful open source projects.
It should serve the following purposes:

- When an idea starts brewing in your brain, feel free to propose that idea here and start a discussion about it.
- If you are looking for something to implement, but just haven't found it yet. This is the place for you.

This repo is useless without people contributing to it. The beauty is that contributaions can come in the
form of ideas, and i believe people are full of ideas.

Having said that, this type of process can sometimes actually have an opposite affect, and opress creativity due to the
variety of ideas and people. Sometimes, its better to not listen to what other people think, and do something even if
you dont have a concensus. So, if you are really passionate about a project, you should do it, regardless of what
the community or anyone else thinks.

## Contributing

There are three forms of contributions to this repository:

- Propose a new project.

To porpose a project all you have to do is create an issue in this repository with a corresponding pull request.
The issue is meant for a general discussion about the idea, and the PR is meant for a
content discussion (More use cases, further elaboration..). The pull request should contain an additional
directory with a minimum of a README file that properly explains your suggestion. When the idea
gets enough votes and if formulated fully, it will be merged to master.

- Discuss and vote

Voting will be managed by the reacations feature:

https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments

Discussions are done like we are all used to on github.

- Start working on a project

You decided to start working on a project, i solute you!.

To do that, simply create a PR updating the status of a project to "Im on it".
Once you are done, create a PR that changes the status to "Reality". Also, please add a
link to the GitHub repo where the development will take place.
